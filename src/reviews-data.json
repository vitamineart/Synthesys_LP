The real-human quality of Synthesys is so good, that I am honestly feeling like my days as a voice-over artist are numbered! The Interface is so easy to use as well. This is a must-have for every marketer and video creator."

As a digital consultant who sells services to local business clients, I can't tell you how much money I've spent on voiceovers over the years. I've stayed away from using AI generated speech because the quality has never competed with the real thing. That has all changed. I LOVE THIS!"

This tool is really wonderful, it is easy to use and it gives me an exceptional rendering. My clientele is 60% French-speaking and this language translation service is simply the best. We would say from real life. Since I tried it, I can't do without it. I use it in the content in the creation of my sales video, promotion and tutorial. Thank you very much to Todd."
